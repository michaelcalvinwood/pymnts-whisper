Visa, the global payments technology company, has made a strategic investment in Terra Pay, a global payments network that enables people and businesses to send and receive money in a quick, low-cost way. Terra Pay touches about 4.5 billion bank accounts, 1.5 billion mobile wallets in about 108 countries. The investment is aimed at enhancing the user experience to deliver funds in mobile wallets via Visa Direct. According to Ruben Salazar Genovez, the Senior Vice President of Digital Payments and Labs for Visa, mobile wallets are becoming an important banking solution for the unbanked, and it is important to extend the network to reach any consumer anywhere.

The investment is a sign of Visa’s support for Terra Pay and some opportunities for the two companies to collaborate more closely. The companies are taking a consumer-centric approach to expand the network, and by the end of 2025, there will be more than 5 billion mobile wallets out there, reaching around 800 million individuals who do not have a debit card or a bank account. Visa’s expansion into the mobile wallet space aims to facilitate digital and financial inclusion, which is an important aspect of the company’s growth.

Moving money between people and businesses cross-border can be complicated and expensive, particularly for small businesses, which are an important part of the global economy. By 2025, $8 trillion in global trade is estimated to occur, and 90 percent of small businesses globally represent the employed segment of the population, driving 70 percent of global GDP. Visa’s investment in Terra Pay and the commercial relationship between the companies will solve some of the problems related to moving money between small businesses. The investment aims to integrate SMBs into a larger, boosting economy and facilitate their participation in digital platforms like Airbnb and the gig economy. Terra Pay will become a digital repository for how small businesses run their business, which is also related to how they run their lives and the financial part of their lives as it affects their cash flow and the needs of their families.

Visa believes that from cross-border environments, it is in the early days of defining better networks. The technology is very fragmented, and there is not a single economic model. Visa aims to support these ecosystems to thrive, bring these digital platforms to more and more consumers, and consolidate networks of networks. Financial inclusion is part digital inclusion, but it is also part of understanding how to collaborate with other networks that are reaching other consumers that Visa is not reaching today. The obstacles to getting scale in some of these markets are enabling a digital connection between the person and their business, which can be complicated, and understanding how to consolidate networks of networks.
