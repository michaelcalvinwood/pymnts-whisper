<h1>The Importance of Stored Payment Credentials in the Digital Payments Landscape</h1>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant shift in online shopping and digital payments. With a growing
    number of digital transactions, customers are having to choose between stored payment credentials and entering these
    credentials manually. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Stripe recently conducted a study on stored payment credentials
    and found that 80% of consumers use stored credentials when they pay online. The study also found that around 93% of
    merchants don't support mobile wallets, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Link by Stripe. This is a missed
    opportunity for merchants as it would be dramatically better for them if they did support these express checkout
    options. It would also be better for consumers who want to leverage these stored credential wallets as well.</p>

<p>According to Josh Ackerman, product lead at Stripe, "Convenient checkout and a good checkout experience have been
    shown to affect 90 percent of consumers' decisions to return to a merchant or not." Consumers care about a
    frictionless checkout experience, and if they are getting to the checkout page and not converting and not making the
    payment, that's the money that merchants are leaving on the table. Merchants need to establish the right payment
    methods and have those saved payment credentials when they're available, leveraging mobile wallets, and using best
    practices when it comes to purchasing one-time goods or subscription goods.</p>

<p>Security is paramount for consumers, and the top reason why they may not complete a checkout flow is that they don't
    feel as if the merchant's website and their checkout experience is secure and trustworthy. At Stripe, they have been
    partnering very closely with AWS to make sure that there are high visibility ways that merchants can communicate to
    their consumers that their checkout flow is secure and trustworthy. AWS takes security very seriously and has a lot
    of tools and services that they offer to their customers to help them secure their environments. They also work with
    partners like Stripe to make sure that they're using the right tools and services to secure their environments as
    well.</p>

<p>Mark Smith, Head of Payments Services at Amazon Web Services, said, "It's really a partnership between AWS, Stripe,
    and our customers to make sure that we're all working together to prevent fraud and keep the payments ecosystem
    secure."</p>

<p>The digital payments landscape is evolving, and it's important for merchants to keep up with the trends and offer
    their customers a frictionless checkout experience. By supporting stored payment credentials and mobile wallets,
    merchants can increase their revenue and conversion points. Consumers want a fast, secure, and trustworthy checkout
    experience, and merchants need to establish the right payment methods and use best practices to ensure that they are
    creating a good customer experience.</p>
