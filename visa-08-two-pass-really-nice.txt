Visa has taken a bold step forward in its mission to reach any consumer, anywhere, by investing in Terra Pay, the global payments network that connects 4.5 billion bank accounts and 1.5 billion mobile wallets across 108 countries. This strategic move is a sign of Visa's commitment to improving user experience and delivering funds quickly and cost-effectively.

With mobile wallets becoming increasingly popular, Visa's investment in Terra Pay is a major step towards their goal of reaching the 800 million individuals who don't have a debit card or bank account by 2025. This move is part of Visa's mission to promote digital and financial inclusion, which is key to the company's expansion.

Small businesses are often faced with the challenge of moving money cross-border, which can be complicated, expensive, and time-consuming. By 2025, global trade is expected to reach $8 trillion, with 90% of small businesses globally representing the employed segment of the population and 70% of GDP globally driven by small businesses. Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay aims to make it easier for small businesses to integrate into a larger, more prosperous economy.

Visa sees the global networks as being in the early stages of development, and recognizes that technology is very fragmented and there is no single economic model. As such, they are taking responsibility to bring these digital platforms to more and more consumers, and supporting these ecosystems to thrive. This investment in Terra Pay is a major step towards Visa's goal of financial inclusion, and consolidating networks of networks to reach more consumers.
