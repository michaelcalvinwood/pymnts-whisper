Visa is making a big move - investing in Terra Pay, the Global Payments Network that reaches an impressive 4.5 billion bank accounts and 1.5 billion mobile wallets across 108 countries. This strategic move is a sign of Visa's commitment to making digital platforms more accessible to more and more consumers and their mission to support these ecosystems as they grow and thrive. As Ruben Salazar Genovez, from Visa, states, “We know that by the end of 2025, there will be more than 5 billion mobile wallets out there. And these 5 billion wallets are reaching around 800 million individuals who do not have a debit card or who do not have a bank account.” Visa's investment in Terra Pay will help to facilitate digital and financial inclusion for those without debit cards or bank accounts, allowing these individuals to participate in the digital economy. 

Moreover, Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay will help to solve the challenges small businesses face when moving money cross-border. Ruben Salazar Genovez further states, “What we are trying to do is to follow the consumer where they are. And in some cases, the only way for small businesses to operate is through these digital wallets in many markets.” With global trade estimated to reach $8 trillion by 2025, and small businesses playing such an important role, Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay will help to ensure that small businesses can continue to operate in a cost-effective, timely manner. 

Visa is dedicated to providing secure, reliable, and affordable financial services to all, and this investment in Terra Pay is a sign of their commitment. As Ruben Salazar Genovez aptly states, “We believe that there is a very large portion of the SMEs around the world not participating in the digital economy. And owning a wallet or participating in a digital platform like Airbnb or any other platforms from the gig economy facilitates their integration into a larger, boosting economy.” Visa's investment in Terra Pay will help to make this integration possible, allowing for greater financial inclusion for all.

Visa's strategic investment in Terra Pay is a major move towards giving mobile wallet users more options - especially for cross-border P2P transactions. With an estimated 5 billion mobile wallets in use by 2025, Visa is taking a consumer-focused approach to widen its network and promote digital and financial inclusion. This investment is part of Visa's mission to bring digital platforms to more people, break down barriers to scaling in some markets, and create a digital connection between people and their businesses.

Small businesses are a vital part of the global economy, and Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay are set to tackle some of the issues they face when transferring money. By taking part in the tools and containers that small businesses use to move money, Visa wants to help them join the larger, booming economy. During the pandemic, small businesses that weren't part of big digital platforms were cut off from the normal economy - and Visa wants to go where the consumer is and support these ecosystems to thrive.

The Visa and TerraPay partnership is set to bring a smoother user experience and less friction when sending funds. Ruben Salazar Genovez of Visa notes, "We believe that we are, from cross-border environments, we are in the early days of defining better networks. Today, the technology is very fragmented. There is not a single economic model." This strategic investment will make it easier for these networks to collaborate and reach consumers that Visa doesn't yet reach.

Mobile wallets are increasingly important for money movement, with around $16 billion every year being transferred between mobile wallets - and that figure is growing at 48 percent year on year. Visa's investment in Terra Pay is a chance to give mobile wallet users more choice, particularly for cross-border P2P transactions. Visa believes that Terra Pay's capabilities will improve the user experience and support all the efforts Visa is making to extend its network to everyone, everywhere.

Salazar Genovez also acknowledges the big barriers to getting the move from a cash to digital environment in these economies, noting, "Probably the largest challenge in the cross-border environment is the different compliance and regulatory postures. In the case of TerraPay, they're operating in 26 different regulatory environments, and every country, every jurisdiction, every regulator has their own rules." Visa's investment in Terra Pay is an important step in breaking down these barriers and promoting digital and financial inclusion.

In conclusion, Visa's investment in Terra Pay is a clear sign of its commitment to consumer-centricity, digital and financial inclusion, and collaboration. It's part of a larger effort to expand the network and bring digital platforms to more and more consumers. This is a responsibility that Visa takes seriously, understanding the need to consolidate the network of networks and partner with other networks to reach consumers that it doesn't currently serve. In short, Visa's investment in Terra Pay is a major step forward in its mission to make digital and financial inclusion a reality.
