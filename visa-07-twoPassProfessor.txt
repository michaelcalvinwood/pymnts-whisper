Visa has just taken a major step in its mission to reach any consumer, anywhere, by investing in Terra Pay, the Global Payments Network that connects 4.5 billion bank accounts and 1.5 billion mobile wallets across 108 countries. This strategic move shows Visa's commitment to enhancing user experience and delivering funds quickly and cost-effectively. 

The importance of Terra Pay's mobile wallet capabilities can't be overstated, especially when it comes to Visa's goal of reaching the 800 million individuals who don't have a debit card or bank account by 2025. It's part of Visa's mission to promote digital and financial inclusion, and to help small businesses take part in the global economy. 

Visa knows that moving money cross-border can be a challenge for small businesses, and that by 2025, global trade will reach $8 trillion. That's why they've made this investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay - to make it easier for SMBs to join the global economy and follow the consumer. 

Visa is also aware that the global networks are still in their early days, with technology fragmented and no single economic model. That's why they're committed to supporting these ecosystems and bringing digital platforms to more and more consumers. Financial inclusion is part of digital inclusion, and it's also about consolidating networks of networks and collaborating with other networks that Visa isn't currently reaching.
