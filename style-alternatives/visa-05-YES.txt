Visa has announced a strategic investment in Terra Pay, the Global Payments Network that reaches 4.5 billion bank accounts and 1.5 billion mobile wallets across 108 countries. This investment is a sign of Visa's support for Terra Pay's capabilities in enhancing user experience and delivering funds quickly and cost-effectively. It also presents an opportunity for Visa to collaborate more closely with Terra Pay.

Terra Pay's capabilities in mobile wallets are particularly important for Visa's goal of extending its network to reach any consumer anywhere, especially those who are unbanked. By 2025, there will be more than 5 billion mobile wallets, reaching around 800 million individuals who do not have a debit card or bank account. Visa's expansion in this world aims to facilitate digital and financial inclusion, an important aspect of its expansion.

For small businesses, moving money cross-border can be complicated, expensive, and time-consuming. Visa estimates that by 2025, global trade will reach $8 trillion, with 90% of small businesses globally representing the employed segment of the population and 70% of GDP globally driven by small businesses. Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay aim to solve some of these problems by facilitating SMBs' integration into a larger, boosting economy, and following the consumer where they are.

Visa believes that the global networks are in the early days of defining better networks, with technology being very fragmented, and not a single economic model. Participating in supporting these ecosystems to thrive is part of Visa's responsibility to bring these digital platforms to more and more consumers. Financial inclusion is part digital inclusion, but it's also part of consolidating networks of networks and collaborating with other networks that are reaching other consumers that Visa is not reaching today.
