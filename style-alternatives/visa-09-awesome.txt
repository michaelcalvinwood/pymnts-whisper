Visa is making a big move - investing in Terra Pay, the Global Payments Network that reaches an impressive 4.5 billion bank accounts and 1.5 billion mobile wallets across 108 countries. This strategic move is a sign of Visa's support for Terra Pay's capabilities in enhancing user experience and delivering funds quickly and cost-effectively. It's also an opportunity for Visa to collaborate more closely with Terra Pay.

Visa's goal of extending its network to reach any consumer anywhere is particularly important, as by 2025 there will be more than 5 billion mobile wallets, with 800 million individuals who don't have a debit card or bank account. Visa's expansion into this world aims to facilitate digital and financial inclusion, a key part of its mission.

Small businesses are often faced with the challenge of moving money cross-border, which can be complex, expensive and time-consuming. With global trade expected to reach $8 trillion by 2025, and 90% of small businesses representing the employed segment of the population and 70% of GDP globally driven by small businesses, Visa's investment and commercial relationship with Terra Pay will help to solve some of these problems by facilitating SMBs' integration into a larger, boosting economy, and following the consumer where they are.

Visa is committed to bringing digital platforms to more and more consumers, and sees this as part of its responsibility to support these ecosystems as they grow and thrive. Financial inclusion is part digital inclusion, but it's also part of consolidating networks of networks and collaborating with other networks that are reaching other consumers that Visa is not reaching today.
